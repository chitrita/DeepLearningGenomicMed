\section{Introduction}

Somatic mutations are any alteration in cell that will not be passed onto future generations\cite{Griffiths2000}. A somatic mutation in a cell of a fully developed organism can have little to no noticeable effect on the organism itself (often leading to benign growths), however mutations that give rise to cancer are a special case. Cancer mutations arise in a special category of genes called proto-oncogenes, many of which regulate cell division. When mutated, such cells enter a state of uncontrolled division and become Oncogenes, resulting in a cluster of cells called a tumor.  There is also mutations in tumor-suppressor genes which can cause tumors by preventing regulation of cell proliferation.

These types of cell division lead to malignant tumors, in which the excessive cell proliferation causes the tumor to spread into surrounding tissues and cause damage. 

This means being capable of discriminating between benign and oncogenic mutations is integral to identifying cancer before the tumor gets too large, or in grows to be in a bad position to excise. In this project we implement each 


\section{Literature review}
CScape was cool, lets make it better.
Gunnar Rasch has a great idea for genomes.

\section{Project plan}

\begin{longtable}{ |p{5cm}|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|  }
	\hline
	Action & Timeframe & Project Relevance \\
	\hline\hline
	Research the problem & Weeks 2-4 & The dataset style used in  the CScape \cite{Rogers2017} and the method proposed in the Framework for Multi-task Multiple Kernel Learning \cite{Widmer2015} are integral to this project, and so should be understood well. \\
	\hline
 	Learn how to apply the Shogun toolkit for toy problems  & Weeks 4-5 & Learning how to use an existing implementation of the Multi-task Multiple Kernel Learning will provide greater insight into expected outputs when used on more complex datasets. \\
 	\hline
 	Gain an understanding of the COSMIC \cite{Forbes2017} data & Weeks 5-6 & Selecting data to be used from the vast database COSMIC will be what is used throughout all of this project. \\
