abstract = {We present a general regularization-based framework for Multi-task learning (MTL), in which the similarity between tasks can be learned or refined using {\$}\backslashell{\_}p{\$}-norm Multiple Kernel learning (MKL). Based on this very general formulation (including a general loss function), we derive the corresponding dual formulation using Fenchel duality applied to Hermitian matrices. We show that numerous established MTL methods can be derived as special cases from both, the primal and dual of our formulation. Furthermore, we derive a modern dual-coordinate descend optimization strategy for the hinge-loss variant of our formulation and provide convergence bounds for our algorithm. As a special case, we implement in C++ a fast LibLinear-style solver for {\$}\backslashell{\_}p{\$}-norm MKL. In the experimental section, we analyze various aspects of our algorithm such as predictive performance and ability to reconstruct task relationships on biologically inspired synthetic data, where we have full control over the underlying ground truth. We also experiment on a new dataset from the domain of computational biology that we collected for the purpose of this paper. It concerns the prediction of transcription start sites (TSS) over nine organisms, which is a crucial task in gene finding. Our solvers including all discussed special cases are made available as open-source software as part of the SHOGUN machine learning toolbox (available at $\backslash$url{\{}http://shogun.ml{\}}).},

abstract = {For somatic point mutations in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, we propose CScape, an integrative classifier for predicting the likelihood that mutations are cancer drivers. Tested on somatic mutations, CScape tends to outperform alternative methods, reaching 91{\%} balanced accuracy in coding regions and 70{\%} in non-coding regions, while even higher accuracy may be achieved using thresholds to isolate high-confidence predictions. Positive predictions tend to cluster in genomic regions, so we apply a statistical approach to isolate coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome that appear enriched for high-confidence predicted disease-drivers. Predictions and software are available at

@article{Shihab2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION The number of missense mutations being identified in cancer genomes has greatly increased as a consequence of technological advances and the reduced cost of whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing methods. However, a high proportion of the amino acid substitutions detected in cancer genomes have little or no effect on tumour progression (passenger mutations). Therefore, accurate automated methods capable of discriminating between driver (cancer-promoting) and passenger mutations are becoming increasingly important. In our previous work, we developed the Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and, using a model weighted for inherited disease mutations, observed improved performances over alternative computational prediction algorithms. Here, we describe an adaptation of our original algorithm that incorporates a cancer-specific model to potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations. RESULTS The performance of our algorithm was evaluated using two separate benchmarks. In our analysis, we observed improved performances when distinguishing between driver mutations and other germ line variants (both disease-causing and putatively neutral mutations). In addition, when discriminating between somatic driver and passenger mutations, we observed performances comparable with the leading computational prediction algorithms: SPF-Cancer and TransFIC. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION A web-based implementation of our cancer-specific model, including a downloadable stand-alone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.},
