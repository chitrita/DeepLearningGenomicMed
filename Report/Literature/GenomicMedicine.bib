abstract = {Most human malignancies are caused by somatic alterations within the cancer genome, leading to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation. The sequence of the human genome has enabled systematic approaches to identify cancer genome alterations, including point mutations, copy number increases and decreases, loss of allelic heterozygosity, and chromosome translocations. Systematic cancer genome analysis has recently led to the discovery of somatic mutations in the BRAF, PIK3CA, and EGFR genes, among others. With further development of targeted cancer therapies and improvement in genome analysis technology, genome-wide surveys of cancer will likely become tools for diagnosis as well as discovery.},

@article{Ding2012,
abstract = {MOTIVATION The study of cancer genomes now routinely involves using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) to profile tumours for single nucleotide variant (SNV) somatic mutations. However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge. RESULTS We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study.

@article{Quang2015,
abstract = {UNLABELLED Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19{\%} relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14{\%} relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD's SVM methodology.

@article{Katsonis2014,
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) generate massive amounts of genomic variant information, and a major challenge is to identify which variations drive disease or contribute to phenotypic traits. Because the majority of known disease-causing mutations are exonic non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (nsSNVs), most studies focus on whether these nsSNVs affect protein function. Computational studies show that the impact of nsSNVs on protein function reflects sequence homology and structural information and predict the impact through statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or models of protein evolution. Here, we review impact prediction methods and discuss their underlying principles, their advantages and limitations, and how they compare to and complement one another. Finally, we present current applications and future directions for these methods in biological research and medical genetics.},

@article{Widmer2015,
abstract = {We present a general regularization-based framework for Multi-task learning (MTL), in which the similarity between tasks can be learned or refined using {\$}\backslashell{\_}p{\$}-norm Multiple Kernel learning (MKL). Based on this very general formulation (including a general loss function), we derive the corresponding dual formulation using Fenchel duality applied to Hermitian matrices. We show that numerous established MTL methods can be derived as special cases from both, the primal and dual of our formulation. Furthermore, we derive a modern dual-coordinate descend optimization strategy for the hinge-loss variant of our formulation and provide convergence bounds for our algorithm. As a special case, we implement in C++ a fast LibLinear-style solver for {\$}\backslashell{\_}p{\$}-norm MKL. In the experimental section, we analyze various aspects of our algorithm such as predictive performance and ability to reconstruct task relationships on biologically inspired synthetic data, where we have full control over the underlying ground truth. We also experiment on a new dataset from the domain of computational biology that we collected for the purpose of this paper. It concerns the prediction of transcription start sites (TSS) over nine organisms, which is a crucial task in gene finding. Our solvers including all discussed special cases are made available as open-source software as part of the SHOGUN machine learning toolbox (available at $\backslash$url{\{}http://shogun.ml{\}}).},

@article{Shihab2013,
abstract = {MOTIVATION The number of missense mutations being identified in cancer genomes has greatly increased as a consequence of technological advances and the reduced cost of whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing methods. However, a high proportion of the amino acid substitutions detected in cancer genomes have little or no effect on tumour progression (passenger mutations). Therefore, accurate automated methods capable of discriminating between driver (cancer-promoting) and passenger mutations are becoming increasingly important. In our previous work, we developed the Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and, using a model weighted for inherited disease mutations, observed improved performances over alternative computational prediction algorithms. Here, we describe an adaptation of our original algorithm that incorporates a cancer-specific model to potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations. RESULTS The performance of our algorithm was evaluated using two separate benchmarks. In our analysis, we observed improved performances when distinguishing between driver mutations and other germ line variants (both disease-causing and putatively neutral mutations). In addition, when discriminating between somatic driver and passenger mutations, we observed performances comparable with the leading computational prediction algorithms: SPF-Cancer and TransFIC.

abstract = {For somatic point mutations in coding and non-coding regions of the genome, we propose CScape, an integrative classifier for predicting the likelihood that mutations are cancer drivers. Tested on somatic mutations, CScape tends to outperform alternative methods, reaching 91{\%} balanced accuracy in coding regions and 70{\%} in non-coding regions, while even higher accuracy may be achieved using thresholds to isolate high-confidence predictions. Positive predictions tend to cluster in genomic regions, so we apply a statistical approach to isolate coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome that appear enriched for high-confidence predicted disease-drivers.
